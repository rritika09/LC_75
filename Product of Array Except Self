#4. Product of Array Except Self
# Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such thatanswer[i] is equal to the product of all
# the elements of numsexcept nums[I].
#The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a32-bit integer.
#You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and withoutusing the division operation.
#Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]  Output: [24,12,8,6]
nums = [1,2,3,4]
prod = 1
out = []
for i in nums:
    prod = i*prod
    #print(prod)
for i in nums:
    out.append(int(prod/i))
print(out)
